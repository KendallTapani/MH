This is a memory/computer interface I want to create but haven’t found the time for yet. Right now, it’s just a basic frontend framework with some pages set up; I haven’t developed the backend yet. It’s something I cranked out in an hour, but it outlines the general idea.

The concept is a memory database that allows me to create new "memories." By "memory," I mean a collection of information. The goal is to create a way to browse through old topics I studied in college or projects I worked on. Anytime I dive into a subject, I could add my notes into this database, organizing them in a way that aligns with how my brain naturally recalls information. I believe there’s a method for storing information optimized for triggering memory recall, though I haven’t worked out all the details yet.

As I’ve gotten older, I’ve noticed that many childhood memories are still in my brain but lack a trigger to bring them to the surface. Occasionally, I’ll experience something that triggers an old memory, which often snowballs into recalling many others. I want to experiment with this trigger mechanism and see if I can artificially stimulate memories using cues like setting descriptions, timestamps, locations, or even classical music. Humans don’t store memories the way databases do—we often associate them with specific times, places, or emotions. I want to capitalize on this, and create something that actually works.
