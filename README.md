This is a memory/computer interface I want to create but haven’t found the time for yet. Currently it is just a frontend shell, waiting for integration with Supabase. The backend is going to be a basic Authenticated CRUD.

The concept is a memory database that allows me to create collections of information, that are easy to recall. The goal is to create a better way to browse through old topics I studied in college or projects I worked on. Anytime I dive into a subject, I could add my notes into this database, organizing them in a way that aligns with how my brain naturally recalls information. I believe there’s a method for storing information optimized for triggering memory recall, though I haven’t worked out all the details yet. Regular computer databases tend to store unused information, because we forget it's there.

As I’ve gotten older, I’ve noticed that many childhood memories are still in my brain but lack a trigger to bring them to the surface. Occasionally, I’ll experience something that triggers an old memory, which often snowballs into recalling many others. I want to experiment with this trigger mechanism and see if I can artificially stimulate memories using cues like setting descriptions, timestamps, locations, or even classical music. Humans don’t store memories in a straightfoward manner—we often associate them with specific times, places, or emotions. I want to try and exploit this mechanism with software, and create a nice GUI that recalls old memories and information. 

Might be some good practice to build my own note taking system.
